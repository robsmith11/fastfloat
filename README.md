# fastfloat

Inspired and based on @bluss's fast-floats:
https://github.com/bluss/fast-floats

I wrote this to speed up my numeric projects, but it should be useful
for most scientific computing applications.

The API is unstable and subject to change.  A nightly rustc is
required. Any feedback, bug reports, and pull requests are very
welcome.
